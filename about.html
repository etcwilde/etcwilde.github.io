<p>
I am a compiler engineer on the Swift team at Apple. I fly small planes,
bake, and hike on the weekends, when my cat isn't curled up on my lap or
demanding attention.
</p>

<p>
I have a Master of Science in computer science from the University of Victoria
in Victoria, BC., under the supervision of Dr. Daniel German. I studied the
human aspects of "how" and "why" people write software, to make the process
easier and less error-prone.

<p>
I have a Bachelor of Science in computer science from the University of
Victoria and graduated with honours.
