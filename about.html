<p>
I am motivated by challenging problems with interesting solutions and
good discussions. I am always interested in learning about new
technologies, and enjoy sharing my discoveries and experiences.
</p>

<p>
I completed a masters of computer science at the University of Victoria
in Victoria, BC. under the supervision of Dr. Daniel German. The focus
of my masters research was in the area of software engineering
practices, investigating how and why people write software, and how to
make the process easier and less error-prone.
</p>

<p>
My masters focuses on providing a better visualization for understanding
how a commit is integrated into the master branch of a repository.
I specifically focused on the Linux kernel repository, which has more
than 8,000 commits per release. The commits are integrated at merges
into the master branch; there are between 275 and 400 integrating merges
per release.
Overall, the structure of the git repository is complex, but can be
decomposed into smaller pieces which are far more manageable.
The results of my thesis work leverages this information in the design
of a tree-based model which are used to construct visualizations in a
tool called Linvis. Linvis is then tested in a user study to verify that
it helps users understand how commits are integrated.
</p>

<p>
The thesis is available at <a href="https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/10053" target="_blank">https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/10053</a>.
</p>

<p>My interests in computer science vary, and I haven't settled for any
single area yet. So far, I have had experience with graphics, algorithm
design, computer networking, systems, and software engineering. I have
done many quirky projects, including an operating system I wrote in
Assembly during the second year of my undergraduate, a data structure
for representing implicit surfaces, among others.
</p>

<p>From 2011 until 2014, I ran a Youtube channel called BlenderWiz,
which provided video tutorials for Blender to create computer generated
images. It had more than 7000 subscribers and more than 600,000 video
views. My most popular series created a model for a 1957 Ford
Thunderbird from scratch. The series included modelling, lighting, and
compositing. It was a challenge to create because some parts were very
complex, requiring a number of different techniques, while other parts
were tedious. I stopped due to time constraints with university.</p>

<p>Most of my time is spent with the computer, but I do get out and do
other things too. I enjoy kayaking, skiing, biking, hiking and camping.
I also enjoy restoring cars, which requires a sizeable time commitment,
which I don't have right now. In high school, I completely restored a
1985 Mazda Rx-7, and I currently have a 1964 Morris Mini Deluxe and a
1961 Chevrolet Suburban that I would like to get back to.</p>
