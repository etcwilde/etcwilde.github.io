## A Journey Awaits

![Raspberry Pi]({{ "assets/img/Pi.png" | absolute_url }})

This is the story of how I implemented an operating system in assembly.
My motivation was to learn how modern programming languages and
operating systems were related to the underlying binary. Until this
point, I had only learned Python and Java, I was just starting C (and
really hating pointers and segfaults), and I was confused about how
high-level concepts like Objects, were translated down to 1's and 0's
that the CPU could actually use.

The work was done as a directed study in my second year under the
supervision of Dr. Yvonne Coady.

This post is brought over from my original university page, which may or
may not remain in existence for much longer, as I am graduating.
Unfortunately, a lot of the content appears to be missing, since I've
also since updated my university page a few years back. I'll do my best
to piece together the parts. For the most part, this will be in
past-tense since it is my recollection.

_I am attempting to write the underlying components of an operating
system for the Raspberry Pi, using the ARMv6 assembly language for the
ARM1176 processor._

Starting out was quite difficult. There were three main challenges that
I had to overcome;

- Learning ARM assembly
- Find and read the documentation on the ARM 1176JZF-s chip that was in
  my device
- Construct a toolchain and workflow to actually get things to work

## Rough Seas Ahead

I started out by trying to get something that would assemble, and also
by following various tutorials.

After learning a bit of ARM assembly, I decided to get to the point
where I could assemble something.

```
@This is a quick test source for my building process for ARM
    .text
    .global _start
_start:
    mov sp, #0x8000   @Set stack pointer to starting position
    mov r1, #42       @Move literal word 42 into register 1
    swi 0x11          @End program

    .data
    .end
```

At the time, I had a very simple bash script that would do the work of
assembling and constructing the kernel image.

```
#!/bin/sh
compiler=arm-none-eabi
code=../code
boot=../boot
debug=../dbg

#First compile the code
$compiler-as $code/init.s -o $code/init.o

#Call the linker to generate the binary output

$compiler-ld $code -o $code/kernel.elf

#Show us the disassembled code for debuging
$compiler-objdump -D $code/init.o > $debug/init.disassembled.s
$compiler-objdump -D $code/kernel.elf > $debug/kernel.disassembled.s

#Now copy into an image format
$compiler-objcopy $code/kernel.elf -O binary $boot/kernel.img
```

Sadly, even though I was following tutorials, this stuff wasn't working.
I kept at the tutorials method until October 2nd. I ended up deciding to
learn the stuff on my own by reading it directly from the manual. This
took me the better part of October, lasting up until the 25th.

## Return with Vengeance

After reading the documentation, I sat down again and hammered something
out. My goal was to get access to the GPIO pins, and most importantly,
the little green LED. Once I had access to that, I could communicate
with the board and see that my code was doing _something_. In the
meantime, I had also written a new setup for doing workflow stuff.

This time, it worked. It compiled, then I put it on the SD card and it
booted right up. [Video](https://youtu.be/N0MC86N0LDo)

This was great news. Yes, I essentially had the month of November
remaining, since December was for finals, but I had something blinking.
It was pretty rough, but I knew that things appeared to be working.

From there, I sat down and figured out how the framebuffer worked and
learned a bit more about the architecture of the chip. Prior intuition
told me that the CPU booted up and got everything going, starting the
GPU in the bootup process. This was actually backward for this chip. The
GPU was the first thing to boot, it loaded up the bootcode.bin and some
other files. Once it was satisfied with all of this, it fired up the
CPU, so the CPU was more like the peripheral processor to the GPU. That
took a bit of time to wrap my head around. The CPU communicated with the
GPU via a mailbox that would get checked when the GPU felt like it. I
sat down and figured out how to get that to work.

My goal was to get colors on the screen. I wasn't entirely sure how that
worked. It was a bit past midnight when I finally got something to work.
Unfortunately, it was a whole lot of bright flashy colors changing as
fast as they could (and of course I had the lights off too). The results
were beautiful. I called this version the "Rave OS" since it was kind of
like how I imagine a rave party to be like.
[Video](https://youtu.be/v-Qok1hXTHE). But it was also kind of expected.

The next goal was to have control over the color space. My OS used a
16-bit colorspace. The first thing I noticed was that 16 doesn't divide
nicely into 3 (for the red, green, and blue channels). So I sat down and
did more reading on how the 16-bit full color system works. It turns out
that there are 5 bits of red, 6 bits of green, and 5 bits of blue.
Interestingly, the choice to have the extra bit of green was
intentional, the human eye is more perceptive to changes in green than
to red or blue because it is right in the centre of the visible light
spectrum. Once I understood how this all worked, I sat down and wrote a
new kernel that would cycle through the color space. The first version
had a few glitches around the points where it would need to start
switching to the next channel. The color would jump from a lot of green,
down to no green and some blue and then keep going. I think I had the
ah-ha moment on how to transition through the full color space smoothly
while I was in a meeting or something. [Video](https://youtu.be/SS6JP1kDI5w)

Then it was time to sit down and work on the actual keyboard stuff.
Unfortunately, I've lost most of the video and files for this part, so
no video. Anyway, I quickly learned about the intricacies of USB. Having
been in electronics in high school, I had some fairly good intuition on
how digital logic worked, but USB was a bit more clever than I was. USB
has (had) four wires. My intuition suggested that one wire was for
positive, one for ground, one for transmission, and the other for
receiving. Kind of like how ethernet works. Nope, I was wrong. So my
intuition on positive and ground were correct, but it turns out that
data is a bit weird. Having one wire for transmission and the other for
receiving actually incurred too many errors given the intended
transmission speeds for usb 2.0. To get around this, the USB designers
decided to essentially add a parity line. One data wire would go high if
it was transmitting a 1, and the other wire would stay low. The Other
wire would go high if it was transmitting a zero. By having the two
lines used for transferring data simultaneously, USB could maintain the
speed and resolve errors (both lines are high or low). Turns out, most
of the stuff surrounding this is implemented in hardware (nice, less
work for me). There was quite a bit of work to implement the stuff for
USB though and it was quite difficult. I didn't have the timers working
correctly yet, so ensuring some of the properties of USB were held was
next to impossible. I ended up writing a driver that was kind of
partially compliant though. By partially compliant, it was able to work
with one keyboard; no other keyboards would work.

Once I had the keyboard thing kind of sorted out, I wanted to be able to
type commands and make the OS do stuff. I wrote out a font. It was
pretty fun since I could make any shape I wanted. Being boring though
(or useful), I stuck with normal characters for the most part. The
bitmap font was essentially a bunch of random numbers, but they
represented the patterns of 1's and 0's where 1 indicated foreground
color, and 0 indicated background color. If I recall correctly, the
bitmaps ended up being an 8x8 grid. The character '0' might be
represented as 0x0038444c54643800. This number by itself isn't that
useful, converted to binary it suddenly pops to life though.

```
00000000
00111000
01000100
01001100
01010100
01100100
00111000
00000000
```

I had the wonderful task of sitting down and drawing out all of the
ascii characters. It was not that much fun, but it was cool to see how
adjusting my font had a visible implication on how the character would
look.

One thing I had forgotten about at this point was endianness though.
Unfortunately, the basic font didn't work because the endianness was
different than what I was writing. Flipping the nibbles, I was able to
get something that would work out.

## Peaceful Seas

Finally, I wrote paint. Sort of. I added a peek and poke command to the
OS, which allowed me to write to arbitrary addresses. Yes, I'm aware
that this is considered very dangerous, but I didn't know how to
implement segmentation faults, or how to write the ethernet driver, so
it didn't matter.

I ended up implementing a little program that would let me draw things
to the framebuffer. I could set the color and the tool. I could draw
text, circles, lines, and rectangles. It turns out, it is really
difficult to draw
[lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) and
[circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm), but
luckily the Wikipedia articles on the matter are quite acceptable.

The final result;

## Land Ho

This project was insane. If you are a little bit insane and really love
low-level work, I would highly recommend doing this. I learned a ton
about how things work. I strongly believe that this has only made me a
better programmer, and at the very least, it's a fun conversation
starter.

- I really don't have an issue with pointers anymore. After having to
  specify every load and store explicitly and then having to manually
  remember, even the raw pointers in C are an amazing improvement.
- I think I have a reasonably good grasp on how modern programming
  languages are compiled down into assembly, and then into machine
  instructions.
- Learned how colors work in the computer.
- Learned about endianness
- Learned assembly

In about the time of a month, I went from having a blinking light to
being able to draw pictures with a command-line version of paint.
