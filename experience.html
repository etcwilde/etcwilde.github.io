<h1>Education</h1>

<div class='box'>
    <h2>Master of Science</h2>
    <span> University of Victoria </span>
    <span> September 2016 - August 2018 </span>

    <p>
    My coursework included machine learning, data mining, linear programming, and music information retrieval.
    The focus of my thesis was on designing a model to summarize how commits are integrated into a git repository, specifically for the Linux kernel. This work included designing the model, developing an algorithm to construct the model from the commit graph, constructing a tool (Linvis, available at http://li.turingmachine.org), and performing a user study to evaluate whether the technique achieved the goal.
    My research focus was in the area of software engineering practices, with the intentions of understanding why programmers make the decisions they do while writing software, determining which decisions result in higher quality code, all while making the task of writing software easier.

    <h2>Bachelor of Science</h2>
    <span> University of Victoria </span>
    <span> September 2012 - April 2016 </span>


    <p>
    Received my bachelors of computer science, having taken a wide variety of courses including; artificial intelligence, computer graphics, computational geometry, compiler construction, database design, computer networking, and security engineering.
    My honors project was in computer graphics, where I implemented the Blob tree, a structure to represent the interactions of implicit surfaces.

<h1>Work Experience</h1>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Intern Compiler Engineer</h2>
    <span> Apple </span>
    <span> January 2018 - September 2018 </span>


    <p>
    Worked on the Clang frontend and LLVM optimizer to help it make better decisions about how code should be optimized, and to take advantage of various features of the hardware. During this internship, I had the opportunity to present my work to the Vice President of MacOS platform experience, Andreas Wendker, and the Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi.
