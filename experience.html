    Worked on the Swift compiler team, helping implement several
    language features including parts of the Swift concurrency model.
    Also worked with other teams, helping them write new performant and
    maintainable Swift code, while integrating it with their existing
    codebases written in several languages. I've made several
    contributions to CMake, improving support for Swift.

    Worked on the Clang frontend and LLVM optimizer to help it make
    better decisions about how code should be optimized, and to take
    advantage of various features of the hardware. During this
    internship, I had the opportunity to present my work to the Vice
    President of MacOS platform experience, Andreas Wendker, and the
    Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi.

<h2>Education</h2>

<div>
    <h3>Master of Science</h3>

    <div class="columns-3">
        <span class="lighten"> University of Victoria </span>

    My coursework included machine learning, data mining, linear
    programming, and music information retrieval. The focus of my thesis
    was on designing a model to summarize how commits are integrated
    into a git repository, specifically for the Linux kernel. This work
    included designing the model, developing an algorithm to construct
    the model from the commit graph, constructing a tool called Linvis,
    and performing a user study to evaluate whether the technique
    achieved the goal.
    </p>

    <p>
    My thesis focused on visualizing the Linux kernel repository, which
    has more than 8,000 commits per release. Commits are merged into
    various subcomponents of the kernel before eventually merging into
    the mainline kernel release. The challenge is for maintainers of the
    kernel to understand what is merged in a given release so that they
    can apply the changes back to older versions for security updates.
    The key was to reverse the edges of the git directed acyclic graph
    and construct trees with edges pointing from a commit toward the
    merge that eventually led to including the commit in the master
    branch of the repository. I designed an algorithm to construct these
    tress and analyzed the resulting trees to verify that they reflected
    what was in the repository. Then I wrote a web-based tool to
    visualize the merge-trees and conducted a user-study to validate the
    claim that the tree visualization helped understand how a given
    commit was merged into the repository, and which commits were merged
    with it.

    Received my Bachelor of Science, in computer science, having taken a
    wide variety of courses including; artificial intelligence, computer
    graphics, computational geometry, compiler construction, database
    design, computer networking, and security engineering. My honors
    project was in computer graphics, where I implemented the Blob tree,
    a structure to represent the interactions of implicit surfaces.

    <p>This paper is an extension of the original, including the details
    of a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the merge-tree
    visualizations, and a discussion on how to extend the algorithm to
    further improve the results and utility.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we describe the design of a tree-based model for
    visualizing how commits are integrated into the Linux kernel git
    repository. This paper includes the design of the algorithm, and
    lists three potential visualizations.</p>
