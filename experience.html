<h2>Education</h2>

<div>
    <h3>Master of Science</h3>

    <div class="columns-3">
        <span class="lighten"> University of Victoria </span>
        <span class="lighten"> Victoria, BC </span>
        <span class="lighten"> September 2016 - August 2018 </span>
    </div>

    <p>
    My coursework included machine learning, data mining, linear programming, and music information retrieval.
    The focus of my thesis was on designing a model to summarize how commits are integrated into a git repository, specifically for the Linux kernel. This work included designing the model, developing an algorithm to construct the model from the commit graph, constructing a tool (Linvis, available at http://li.turingmachine.org), and performing a user study to evaluate whether the technique achieved the goal.
    My research focus was in the area of software engineering practices,
    with the intentions of understanding why programmers make the
         decisions they do while writing software, determining which
         decisions result in higher quality code, all while making the
         task of writing software easier.

    Received my bachelors of computer science, having taken a wide variety of courses including; artificial intelligence, computer graphics, computational geometry, compiler construction, database design, computer networking, and security engineering.
    My honors project was in computer graphics, where I implemented the Blob tree, a structure to represent the interactions of implicit surfaces.

    </div>

    <p>This paper is an extension of the original, including the details
    of a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the merge-tree
    visualizations, and a discussion on how to extend the algorithm to
    further improve the results and utility.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In this paper, we describe the design of a tree-based model for
    visualizing how commits are integrated into the Linux kernel git
    repository. This paper includes the design of the algorithm, and
    lists three potential visualizations.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In this paper, we investigated the uses of GitHub Gist; a feature
    in GitHub that is similar in concept to a Pastebin, but with the full
    functionality of a git repository.</p>
